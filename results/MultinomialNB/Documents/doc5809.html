The Accused is charged with one count of Rape. 2. After trial three assessors have in their unanimous opinion found the accused not guilty. 3. I direct myself in accordance with the summing up I gave the assessors today. The only element of the offence in issue was, whether the victim consented to sexual intercourse with the accused. 4. I have reviewed the evidence adduced in this trial and I find that the unanimous opinion of the assessors is not perverse. 5. I agree with the assessors and find the accused not guilty of the offence. 6. I acquit the accused accordingly. Priyantha Fernando Judge 27th June 2012.</p></div></div></body></html>
