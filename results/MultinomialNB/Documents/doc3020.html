AAU0012 OF 2002S (High Court Criminal Action No. HAC009 of 2001S) BETWEEN: LEONE LAUTABUI Appellant AND: THE STATE Respondent APPLICATION FOR BAIL PENDING APPEAL No grounds have been advanced for bail, except the delay in bringing the appeal ready for hearing. According to the file, the Record has been completed and is ready for copying. I direct that a copy made available to the appellant as soon as possible. The case should be listed for hearing at the November 2003 sittings. In light of these directions I do not consider there are sufficient grounds for granting bail. The application is refused. Dated 21 August 2003. Thomas Eichelbaum JUDGE OF APPEAL</p></div></div></body></html>
