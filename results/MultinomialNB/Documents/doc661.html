Sir Mari Kapi, Justice of Appeal Hearing: Tuesday, 14 November 2000, Suva Counsel: Mr. K. Bulewa for the Appellant Mr. I. Fa for the Respondent Date of Decision: Tuesday, 14 November 2000 DECISION The only explanation for the delay by the applicant - negotiation to settle - I find that the respondents position was clear as far back as April that they would, not settle unless full purchase price was paid on settlement. When the offer was clarified beyond doubt the applicant did not make application for extension. The applicant has not satisfactory explained delay. As to the merits, the applicant simply relies on the argument that there are important questions. This does not go for enough to demonstrate an arguable case. I dismiss the application. Costs of this application to the respondent. Sir Mari Kapi (Sgd) Justice of Appeal Solicitors: Messrs. K. R. Bulewa and Associates, Suva for the Appellant Messrs. I. Fa and Company, Suva for the Respondent</p></div></div></body></html>
