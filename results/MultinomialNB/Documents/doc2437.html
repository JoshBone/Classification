ABU0035 OF 2006 (High Court Civil Action No. HBC 68/2001L) BETWEEN: MADHWAN KESHWAN (f/n Keshwan Raman) Appellant AND: KESHNI DEVI (f/n Narsaiya) First Respondent AND: SHAILEND R KRISHNA (f/n Ram Krishna) Second Respondent AND: REGISTRAR OF TITLES Third Respondent Coram: Scott, JA McPherson, JA Ford, JA Date of Hearing: 16 March 2007 Counsel: Dr. M.S.D. Sahu Khan Ms S. Sahu Khan for the Appellant Ms T. Draunidalo for the First Respondent S.K. Ram for the Second Respondent Ms M. Rakuita for the Third Respondent Date of Judgment: 23 March 2007 JUDGMENT OF McPHERSON, JA [1] I entirely agree with the orders proposed and with the reasons given by LJ Scott for dismissing this appeal. Even before the Judicature Act, the rule was settled that actual service of the writ or other originating process is not essential. "If the defendant appears, that gives the Court juirisdiction to proceed, provided the subjectmatter of the action is one over which the Court has jurisdiction." See Oulton v Radcliffe (1874) LR 9 CPO 189, 195. Here the proceedings were for partial administration of the trusts of a deceased estate under the will, of which probate had been granted in Fiji. The subject-matter was therefore clearly within the jurisdiction of the High Court. The decision in Boyle v. Sacker (1888) 39 Ch D 249 cited by my Lord is to the same effect, and concerned proceedings like this on motion or originating summons.
