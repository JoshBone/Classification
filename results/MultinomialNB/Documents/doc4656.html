HBA0009 OF 2003 BETWEEN: DAYA RAM and DHARAM RAJI APPELLANTS AND: SUMITRA GOUNDAR RESPONDENT Mr M S Sahu Khan for the Appellant No appearance for the Respondent Date of Hearing: 5 July 2005 Date of Judgment: 5 July 2005 ORAL JUDGMENT OF FINNIGAN J This is an appeal against a Magistrates order refusing costs. The Respondent appears to have taken no steps and was not represented today at the hearing. I have heard the submissions of Counsel for the Appellant who has taken me through the history of the matter and I am satisfied that the Magistrate was in error in refusing an order for an indemnity costs as sought by the Appellant in the lower Court. I accept the authority of Cooper v- Whittingham 15 Ch D 501 as authority for the proposition that in an action to enforce a legal right where there has been no misconduct by the Plaintiff there is no discretion in the Court to refuse costs. I am satisfied by the evidence that in the lower Court there was not only no misconduct apparent on the part of the Plaintiff but the Defendant caused increased costs after admitting the debt and then prolonging the action and avoiding payment. The appeal is allowed and the Respondent is ordered to pay the indemnity costs specified and sought in the Magistrates Court at $856.00. I assess costs for the Appellant on todays hearing including disbursements on the appeal in the sum of $700.00. D.D. Finnigan JUDGE At Lautoka 5 July 2005</p></div></div></body></html>
