Case No: HAM 84 of 2004S Between: THE STATE Applicant And: 1. MESULAME RORAVUDI 2. LEVANI NAKAINAILEGA 3. ISIKELI BAULEKALEKA 4. MAIKELI NAIYALA 5. ISAIA WAIROGA Respondents Hearing: 25th February 2005 Ruling: 25th February 2005 Counsel: Ms L. Chandra for State Respondents in Person RULING This is an application by the State to extend time to appeal. They are 29 days out of time. The reason for the delay is that the order of the Magistrates Court was only brought to their attention by the victim who had no legal representation. They further say that the offences were not reconcilable and section 163 of the Criminal Procedure Code could not have applied in law and in fact. I consider that good cause has been shown by the State to enlarge time. Leave is granted to appeal out of time. Nazhat Shameem JUDGE At Suva 25th February 2005</p></div></div></body></html>
