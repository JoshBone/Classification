Misc. Case No: HAM0080 of 2004S Between: JOSUA RAITAMATA Applicant And: THE STATE Respondent Hearing: 20th December 2004 Ruling: 20th December 2004 Counsel: Applicant in Person Ms N. Tikoisuva for State RULING The Applicant was sentenced to years imprisonment in either June or August of this year. He has submitted correspondence to me which show that he made earnest attempts to communicate with the court from the 9th of September 2004 and to file an appeal. In the light of the fact that he was making these attempts from prison and is unrepresented, I consider he has shown good cause. Leave to appeal is granted. Nazhat Shameem JUDGE At Suva 20th December 2004</p></div></div></body></html>
