AAU0107of 2013 High Court Case No. HAC 0084 of 2009L BETWEEN: SANJEEV MOHAN Appellant AND: THE STATE Respondent Coram : Goundar JA Counsel : Appellant in person Mr. M. Delaney for the Respondent Date of Hearing : 8 April 2014 Date of Ruling : 17 April 2014 RULING [1] On 7 March 2013, the appellant filed an appeal against a voir dire ruling admitting his caution interview in evidence in a case before the High Court at Lautoka. Subsequently, he was tried and acquitted in the case in which that voir dire ruling was made. [2] Clearly, the appeal against the voir dire ruling is an interlocutory appeal. The Court of Appeal has no jurisdiction to hear the appeal. Furthermore, the acquittal of the appellant has made this appeal academic. [3] Section 35(2) of the Court of Appeal gives a single judge power to dismiss an appeal that is bound to fail because there is no right of appeal. [4] In this case, I am satisfied that the appeal is bound to fail because there is no right of appeal. [5] The appeal is dismissed under section 35(2) of the Court of Appeal Act. Hon. Justice D. Goundar JUSTICE OF APPEAL</p></div></div></body></html>
