HBC0591R OF 1998S BETWEEN: MACIU MELINIBULA of Nabua Village, Koro Islands, Farmer. PLAINTIFF AND: ATTORNEY-GENERAL OF FIJI DEFENDANT Counsel for the Plaintiff: N/A Counsel for the Defendant: H. Rabuku: Attorney-Generals Chambers Date of Ruling: 27.09.2005 Time of Ruling: 9.30 a.m. EX-TEMPORE RULING Although this is the Plaintiffs application to restore the action to the list, Counsel had failed to appear at the hearing. For reasons that are obvious from the evidence and the affidavit of the Defendant, the Court has no alternative but to order that the Plaintiffs action be dismissed. Not only has there been a total lack of effort on the part of the Plaintiff to prosecute the proceedings with despatch, but the long delay has placed the defence in an awkward if not prejudicial position. According to Counsel, the Defendants witnesses after the action began in 1998, for an offence allegedly committed in 1994, will have to be traced, and in some cases they have left the country permanently. It would, under all the circumstances of this case, be totally devoid of merit and unjustified, if the Plaintiff was allowed to now proceed with his action. The Plaintiffs action is dismissed. No order as to costs. F. Jitoko JUDGE At Suva 27 September 2005</p></div></div></body></html>
