Mr. Justice Goundar Counsel : Appellant in Person Ms P. Madanavosa for the Respondent Date of Hearing : 22 July 2014 Date of Ruling : 25 July 2014 RULING [1] The appellant appeared in the High Court at Suva on numerous charges of aggravated robbery. He was refused bail pending trial by the High Court. [2] The appellant filed an appeal against the High Court's refusal of bail pending trial. While that appeal was pending, the State entered a nolle prosequi against all the charges and terminated the proceedings against the appellant. [3] The State submits that this appeal is now purely academic because the High Court proceedings have been terminated and the appellant was discharged. [4] I accept the State's submission. The appellant is no longer in custody on remand and the question of bail is now academic. The appeal cannot possibly succeed and is therefore frivolous. [5] The appeal is dismissed under section 35(2) of the Court of Appeal Act. &&&&&&&&&&& Hon. Justice D.
