Action HAC0005.2002 STATE V SEKONIA TOKA Fiji High Court, Suva 8 September 2003 Gates J JUDGMENT Mr W. Kurisaqila for the State Mr Anil Singh for the Accused I have directed myself in accordance with the summing up and after a consideration of the evidence and the opinion of the assessors, I have no difficulty in finding the case against the Accused is not proved. In bringing in a verdict of not guilty I do not do so because of a doubt I harbour, but I do so because I am convinced he is not responsible for the crime. The Accused is acquitted, and is discharged. Sekonaia Toka you may stand down from the dock. I express my thanks to the 3 assessors for their careful deliberations. A.H.C.T.
