Babitu for the State Ms. Sharma for the Accused Date of Judgment : 03rd May 2013 JUDGMENT [1] Trial commenced on the 30th April 2013 and concluded on the 3rd May 2013. All three assessors unanimously found the Accused guilty on all four counts of Indecent Assault. [2] I direct myself in accordance with the law and the evidence which I discussed in my Summing Up to the assessors. [3] Considering the nature of the evidence before the court I am convinced that the prosecution had proved the case beyond reasonable doubt. [4] I find the verdict of the assessors were not perverse. It was open to them to reach such a conclusion on the evidence. I conquer their verdict. Considering all I find the Accused guilty as charged. [5] Accordingly I convict Bokini Nailati for three counts of indecent assault punishable under Section 154(1) of the Penal Code and one count of indecent assault punishable under Section 212(1) of the Crimes Decree. S. Thurairaja Judge At Lautoka 03rd May 2013 Solicitors: The Office of the Director of Public Prosecution for State Legal Aid Commission for Accused</p></div></div></body></html>
