The appellant was sentenced to an effective term of 8 years imprisonment in the Magistrates Court for robbery with violence and other charges. The High Court dismissed his appeal against sentence. 2. The appellant has brought a further appeal to this Court against his sentence. A second appeal is possible only where the ground of appeal involves solely a question of law - Court of Appeal Act s.22(1). 3. The appellants Notice of Appeal does not involve any question of law.
