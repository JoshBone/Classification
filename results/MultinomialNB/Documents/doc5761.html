AKASH ASHWIN Hearing: 5th October 2004 Ruling: 5th October 2004 Counsel: Mr. W. Kuruisaqila & Ms K. Bavou for State Ms B. Malimali for Accused RULING Although I am satisfied that the prosecution was unable to contact this witness and that section 290 of the Criminal Procedure Code applies to this application, I consider that because there is no dispute about the accused inflicting the stab wound, there is little probative value in the dying declaration in the statement of Nirmala Devi. In the circumstances I refuse the States application to have the statement read. Nazhat Shameem JUDGE At Suva 5th October 2004</p></div></div></body></html>
