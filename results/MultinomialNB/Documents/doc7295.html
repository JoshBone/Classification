Case No: HAC0004 of 2005S STATE v. JOSUA NATAKURU Hearing: 7th October 2005 Ruling: 7th October 2005 Counsel: Mr. D. Prasad & Ms S. Puamau for State Accused in Person RULING The Accused asks for more time to prepare cross-examination of the Investigating Officer. This trial is now being held 4 years after the allege offence. It is a retrial. The Accused has had ample time to prepare his cross-examination questions, and he has conducted his defence ably thus far. Indeed his questions at the voir dire were searching and relevant. Any adjournment of this officers evidence will result in further delay in the trial. That is not in the Accuseds best interests. Nor is it desirable for the Assessors. Furthermore my role is to ensure that the Accused is not prejudiced by lack of representation. That includes assisting him with questions. It is not in the interests of justice to further adjourn the trial. It will proceed this afternoon. Nazhat Shameem JUDGE At Suva 7th October 2005</p></div></div></body></html>
