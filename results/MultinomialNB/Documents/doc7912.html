SENITIKI ROQARA Hearing: 30th January 2004 Ruling: 30th January 2004 Mr. B. Solanki for State Respondent - In Person RULING The State applies for leave to appeal out of time. The Respondent objects but in the course of objection he says that his plea was equivocal. It seems to me that it is in his interests that I consider the nature of the plea in an appeal. Further a probation order for a series of robbery with violence convictions is so unusual that the State has shown that there are merits in the appeal. Finally the appeal is only slightly out of time. Leave granted. Appeal to be filed by 6/2/04 and to take normal course. Nazhat Shameem JUDGE At Suva 30th January 2004</p></div></div></body></html>
