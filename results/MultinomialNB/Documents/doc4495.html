Appeal No. AAU0034(B) of 2013 [Nasinu MC Case No. 483 of 2012] BETWEEN: ERONI QIO Appellant AND: THE STATE Respondent Coram : Hon. Mr. Justice Goundar Counsel : Appellant in person Ms P. Madanavosa for State Date of hearing : 22 July 2014 Date of ruling : 25 July 2014 RULING [1] The appellant was charged with indecent assault and aggravated robbery. His application for bail was refused by the Magistrates' Court exercising extended jurisdiction of the High Court. [2] The appellant filed an appeal to this Court against the refusal of bail. While this appeal was pending, the appellant was tried and acquitted of the charges. In these circumstances, the question of bail pending trial is now academic. The appeal cannot possibly succeed and is frivolous. [3] The appeal is dismissed under section 35(2) of the Court of Appeal Act. .......................................... Hon. Justice D. Goundar JUDGE OF APPEAL At Suva 25 July 2014 Solicitors: Appellant in person Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions for State</p></div></div></body></html>
